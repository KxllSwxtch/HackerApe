### Hey! 

My name is Dmitriy and I am an aspired üíª Full-Stack Developer and a Data Analyst from  Ottawa, Canada üá®üá¶. 

### Short Story of Mine
I was always thinking that I am not that type of a person who can sit all day everyday and code, because I loved movement. And I still do! But when I first came to Canada and came across the SEO development and got my first laptop I first watched the youtube tutorial on how to create a landing page with HTML and CSS. That day has completely changed my life, I started learning JavaScript, Python and landed my first job after a year of learning as a [Freelancer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freelancer.asp). 

After a couple of years working as a Freelancer I've got a job as a WordPress Developer at [Discount Audio Visual](http://discountaudiovisual.ca/). After being a WordPress Developer I began aiming for a Machine Learning area but that (unfortunately) didn't work for me. So I decided to stay on the Web Development and keep mastering my skills and widen my knowledge.

And now, I am on the path to become a Data Analyst and achieve an expertise in this field. I love working with numbers, data processing such as scraping/extracting, filtering/cleaning, and making some calculations based on the values that are provided in order to help companies perform better and to help them better understand of the current state of it.
